""Something's wrong, I can feel it.""Six minutes. Six Minutes. Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!""Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; and if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances.""""You are just what the doc ordered.""[Chorus 1]I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap GodAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nodNow who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot[Verse 1]But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocketMy pen'll go off when I half-cock itGot a fat knot from that rap profitMade a livin' and a killin' off itEver since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsackI'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hellSyllables, skill-a-holic (kill 'em all with)This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hopYou don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' thatI'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in halfOnly realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the factHow could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attackRappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi padIt's actually disastrously bad for the wackWhile I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece[Chorus 2]'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nodNow who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hardEverybody want the key and the secret
To rap immortality like I have got[Verse 2]Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberanceEverybody loves to root for a nuisanceHit the Earth like an asteroidDid nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)MC's get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bust a rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of studentsMe? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of FameEven though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flamesOnly Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fameOn the wall of (shame)You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boyYou're witnessin' a massacre
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy""Oy vey, that boy's gay!"" – that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the backAnd a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boyI'ma work for everything I have, never ask nobody for shitGet outta my face, lookin' boy!Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—[Chorus 3]I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God

This planet's Krypton – no, Asgard, Asgard[Verse 3]So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You're rodent, I'm omnipotentLet off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'And I should not be wokenI'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'I'm out my Ramen NoodleWe have nothin' in common, poodleI'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupilIt's me, my honesty's brutalBut it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a whileSo I wanna make sure, somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymesTo maybe try to help get some people through tough timesBut I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case, 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtimeI know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grindSo I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mineYou get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portalYou're stuck in a time warp from 2004 thoughAnd I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme forYou're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrowsYou write normal? Fuck being normal!And I just bought a new Raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channelSo Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a humanWhat I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhumanInnovative and I'm made of rubber, so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you andI'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitatingNever fading, and I know the haters are forever waitingFor the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivatedI make elevating music, you make elevator music""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,"" – 'cause I found a hella way to fuse itWith rock, shock rap with DocThrow on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' youHow many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins to?Ungh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung meFull of myself, but still hungryI bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind toAnd I'm a million leagues above youIll when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you!I'm drunk – so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seatBumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils, and here's what they want from meThey're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hateBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatredI have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discriminationBut fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?Don't mistake him for (Satan); it's a fatal mistakeIf you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face andDon't be a retard! Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?[Produced by DVLP]",Male

So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's out of ammo?Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapperHow the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel

And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (let's talk about it)I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (talk about it)I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)

And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy[Verse 1: Eminem]I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be chooseyWanted to receive attention for my musicWanted to be left alone in public, excuse meFor wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both waysFame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leafAbused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Ooh! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweetIt was like winnin' a used minkIronic ‘cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrinkI'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheepGoing coo-coo and kooky as Kool KeithBut I'm actually weirder than you think, ‘cause I'm—[Chorus: Rihanna and (Bebe Rexha)]I'm friends with the monster that's under my bedGet along with the voices inside of my headYou're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath

But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it‘Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjurin'Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn fromYeah, ponderin' will do you wonders
No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wandersYodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict‘Cause the very thing that I love's killing me
And I can't conquer it
My OCD is conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—[Chorus: Rihanna and (Bebe Rexha)]I'm friends with the monster that's under my bedGet along with the voices inside of my headYou're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath

One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilianBut until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled andI'll take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'

But if one kid out of a hundred million

Eminem,Lose Yourself,https://genius.com/Eminem-lose-yourself-lyrics,"[Intro]Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip?[Verse 1]Yo! His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghettiHe's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity, ohThere goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dopeHe knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsodyBetter go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
[Chorus]You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yoYou better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…
[Verse 2]His soul's escaping through this hole that is gapingThis world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World OrderA normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harderHomie grows hotter, he blows, it's all overThese hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roadsGod only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughterBut hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold productThey moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partnerBut the beat goes on: da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah[Chorus]You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yoYou better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…[Verse 3]No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changedI've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypherBest believe somebody's payin' the Pied PiperAll the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my lifeAnd these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donnaBaby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shotSuccess is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's notMom, I love you, but this trailer's gotTo go; I cannot grow old in Salem's LotSo here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
[Chorus]You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yoYou better lose yourself in the music

Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
[Verse 1: Eminem]He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get backIt's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-packShe's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the backKnife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""
After the first night, but tonight I am

It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to youSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a boothI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursueWhy do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me

Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run

Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey!""Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my babyThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangledWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me

I was the master of my fate
I never needed anybody in my life
I learned the truth too late
I'll never shake away the pain
I close my eyes but she's still there
I let her steal into my melancholy heart
It's more than I can bear

Now I know she'll never leave me
Even as she runs away
She will still torment me
Calm me, hurt me
Move me, come what may
Wasting in my lonely tower
Waiting by an open door
I'll fool myself, she'll walk right in
And be with me for evermore

I rage against the trials of love
I curse the fading of the light
Though she's already flown so far beyond my reach
She's never out of sight

Now I know she'll never leave me
Even as she fades from view
She will still inspire me
Be a part of everything I do
Wasting in my lonely tower
Waiting by an open door

Josh Groban,We Are The World 25 For Haiti,https://genius.com/Artists-for-haiti-we-are-the-world-25-for-haiti-lyrics,"[Verse 1: Justin Bieber, Nicole Scherzinger, Jennifer Hudson, Jennifer Nettles, Josh Groban, Tony Bennett, and Mary J. Blige]There comes a time
When we heed a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
Oh, and it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all
We can't go on
Pretending day by day
That someone, somehow will soon make a change
We are all a part of
God's great big family
And the truth, you know love is all we need
[Hook: Michael Jackson & Janet Jackson, Barbra Streisand]We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus, Enrique Iglesias, Nicole Scherzinger, Jamie Foxx]
Well, send them your heart (oh)
So they'll know that someone cares
So their cries for help
Will not be in vain
We can't let them suffer
No, we cannot turn away
Right now, they need a helping hand
[Hook: Wyclef Jean, Adam Levine, Pink, BeBe Winans]Nou sé mond la
We are the Children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
[Bridge: Michael Jackson, Usher, Celine Dion, Fergie]
When you're down and out
There seems no hope at all
But if you just believe
There's no way we can fall
Well, well, well, let us realize
Oh, that a change can only come
When we stand together as one
[Hook: All (+ Nick Jonas, Toni Braxton, Mary Mary, Tony Bennett, Isaac Slade)]
We are the world (we are the world)
We are the children (we are the children)
We are the ones who make a brighter day

We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day

Saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
[Rapping: LL Cool J, Will.I.Am, Snoop Dogg, Busta Rhymes, Swizz Beatz, Iyaz, Mann]
We all need somebody that we can lean on
When you wake up look around and see that your dreams gone
When the earthquakes we'll help you make it through the storm
When the floor breaks a magic carpet to stand on
We are the World, united by love so strong
When the radio isn't on, you can hear the songs
A guided light on the dark road your walking on
A sign post to find the dreams you thought was gone
Someone to help you move the obstacles you stumbled on
Someone to help you rebuild after the rubble's gone
We are the World, connected by a common bond
Love, the whole planet sing it along
[Hook: All]
We are the world (we are the world)
We are the children (we are the children)
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving (let's start giving)

You and I
You and I
Uh, 12 days no water
What's your will to live?
We amplified the love we watching multiply
Feeling like the world's end
We can make the World win
Like Katrina, Africa, Indonesia
And now Haiti needs us, they need us, they need us

We are the world
We are the children (we are the children)

Josh Groban,Dust and Ashes,https://genius.com/Josh-groban-dust-and-ashes-lyrics,"PIERREIs this how I die?
Ridiculed and laughed at
Wearing clown shoes
Is this how I die?
Furious and reckless
Sick with booze
How did I live?
I taste every wasted minute
Every time I turned away
From the things that might have healed me
How long have I been sleeping?
Is this how I die?
Frightened like a child
Lazy and numb
Is this how I die?
Pretending and preposterous
And dumb
How did I live?
Was I kind enough and good enough?
Did I love enough?
Did I ever look up
And see the moon
And the stars
And the sky?
Oh why have I been sleeping?
They say we are asleep
Until we fall in love
We are children of dust and ashes
But when we fall in love we wake up
And we are a God
And angels weep
But if I die here tonight
I die in my sleep
All of my life I spent searching the words
Of poets and saints and prophets and kings
And now at the end all I know that I’ve learned
Is that all that I know is I don’t know a thing
So easy to close off
Place the blame outside
Hiding in my room at night
So terrifiedAll the things I could have been
But I never had the nerve
Life and love
I don’t deserve
So all right, all right
I’ve had my time
Close my eyes
Let the death bells chimeBury me in burgundy
I just don’t care
Nothing’s left
I looked everywhere
Is this how I die?
Was there ever any other way my life could be?
Is this how I die?Such a storm of feelings inside of me?
But then why am I screaming?
Why am I shaking?
Oh God, was there something that I missed?Did I squander my divinity?
Was happiness within me the whole time?
They say we are asleep
Until we fall in love
We are children of dust and ashes
But when we fall in love we wake up
And we are a God
And angels weep
But if I die here tonight
I die in my sleep
They say we are asleep
Until we fall in love
And I’m so ready
To wake up now
I want to wake up
Don’t let me die while I’m like this
I want to wake up
God don’t let me die while I’m like this
Please let me wake up now
God don’t let me die while I’m like thisI’m ready
I’m ready
To wake up",Male

And for no obvious reason
That I can't go on
Living as I am
The zest of life has vanished
Only the skeleton remains

I drink too much
Right now, my friend fights and bleeds
And I sit at home and read
Hours at a timeHours at my screen
Anything, anything
Abandoned to distraction
In order to forget

Because I'm married
But not in love
Frozen at the center

Pick up, listen, if you wanna get rich
No sleep, how real bad man wake up

And I've been sleeping with 'em
And now I'm tangled in the sheets and sinking deeper with 'em
I'm going deeper in it, find me drownin' in it

Breaking the mold mentally, master with no limiting
Making 'em say ""ugh!"", they worshipping our force viciously
Watching the floor tip in your temple of authenticity
Often they say I’m off it, I offer my crossed empathy
They forgot what we on, I’ll remind 'em with hostility

Gotta cover your clams and take another glance
Running a clinic, no scans, ain't no one claimin' yo mans

Three hundred dollars to my name, led to Hollywood

And after high school, you better get a degree
'Cause it's a dog-eat-dog world, you could live in the street""Flashback, I had my Walkman in the minivanListening to NSYNC, saw my name on the CD

It's kinda sick and I was born in 1996 and1999 the only year that I remember
I slip through the cracks without havin' a damn temper
I bleach my hair because these bitches all about they bitchin'I say shit when I rap and y'all niggas barely listenI do the most for the culture, nigga, by just existingDelete my tweets 'cause I'm ashamed of being a fuckin' SimpsonI told my mom I was gay, why the fuck she ain't listen?I signed a pub deal and her opinion fuckin' disappearin'
I'm payin' bills for my sister and tryna fund her businessIs it homophobic to only hook up with straight niggas?
You know like closet niggas, masc-type?
Why don't you take that mask off?
That's the thought I had last night""Why you always rap about bein' gay?""
'Cause not enough niggas rap and be gayWhere I come from, niggas get called ""faggot"" and killed

And they can come and cut my head off and

Beat your ass before you got time to say ""why not?""Here to catch ya slip up, wish you could just rewind

I look you in your eyes, say ""fuck you, are you fuckin' stupid?""Respect my mother, 'spect my sister, 'spect these women, boyI get my 9-9, I don't own one, hit the store to blow your brains off
Better hope my aim off, better hope the range off
Better hope my tame off before I blow your brains off, boy

But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I ownAnd in your eyes, you're holding mine

She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home

Fighting against all odds

Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me

If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
[Verse 1: Eminem]He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get backIt's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-packShe's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the backKnife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""
After the first night, but tonight I am

Been a lover, been a cheat

A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to youSo I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a boothI just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursueWhy do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey!""Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my babyThis love triangle left us in a wreck, tangledWhat else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real

One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by

And I can't wait to go home

These old country lanes

Prince,Let's Go Crazy,https://genius.com/Prince-and-the-revolution-lets-go-crazy-lyrics,"[Spoken Intro]Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called ""life""Electric word, life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you
There's something else
The afterworldA world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or nightSo when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, babyCause in this life
Things are much harder than in the after world
In this life
You're on your ownAnd if de-elevator tries to bring you downGo crazy (Punch a higher floor!)
Woo!
[Verse 1]If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around
At least you got friends
You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phoneDropped it on the floor
(Ah-s ah-s) is all I heard
[Pre-Chorus]Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?Oh, no lets go!
[Chorus]Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go!
[Verse 2]We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's cause
We're all gonna dieAnd when we do (when we do)
What's it all for (what's it all for)
You better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door
[Pre-Chorus]Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?Oh, no let's go!

Let's go crazy
Let's get nutsLook for the purple banana

Sunday morning man
She woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mindEnded up at a Shell on I-65
[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymoreOh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours
[Verse 2]
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologizeWhen she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinking that her leaving
Is the only logical reason
[Chorus 2]
That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours
[Bridge]Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out
[Chorus 1]
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation

And you give it all

She follows me around
So you get what's left of me

And found something new worth living for
And a, old dusty hand-me-down six string

A little more with every song
So sing a-long

He was there, but I didn't care, to busy staring at you
In the pouring rain, with the blue lights flashin', in the hills of Appalachian
Close to tears with your makeup smeared, I asked you what had happened

She won't be for awhile
And he broke her down
When I'm around
I can see it in her smile
She's finally getting closer
It's just to plain to see
And I know she ain't ready
But that's alright with me

You wearing that red dress, pearls, and those high heels
Like the way he made you look, you look the way it made you feel
So I said to you I sure like to do this one here
You said me too, but I'm just not over him

With a ring in hand, I said ""I'm your man, and girl, will you marry me?""

Are you staring a hole through your phone, praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Or maybe playing some Mayer, getting lost in your favorite lines

You just might be doing whatever it takes
To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice

But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess

Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite songs?
Well maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes, I'm moving on

In the city where the sun don't set
And every day you know where we ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me
Singing
[Chorus: Halsey & Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your whole life then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life, together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now

Heart breaking on a broken bar stool
Wishing she'd come running back
Running from the past

Dragged me out on the town
Had to pick me up

I don't hate you, but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no moreNo, I don't fear no more
Better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more

If I could take this in a shot right now

Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?”

Far away from the wreck we made

Number one, tell me who you think you are
You got some nerve trying to tear my faith apart

I have questions for you
I have questions for you (I have questions)

And why'd you have to go and spit it out?

But it sounds so dangerous to me now

Do you care, do you care?
Why don't you care?I gave you all of me
My blood, my sweat, my heart, and my tears
Why don't you care, why don't you care?

Now you're gone, and I'm here

Dressed up like you're somethin' elseWhere you are and where it's at, you see

Avril Lavigne,Head Above Water,https://genius.com/Avril-lavigne-head-above-water-lyrics,"[Verse 1]
I've gotta keep the calm before the storm
I don’t want less, I don't want more
Must bar the windows and the doors
To keep me safe, to keep me warm
Yeah, my life is what I'm fighting for
Can’t part the sea, can't reach the shore
And my voice becomes the driving force
I won't let this pull me overboard
[Chorus]God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don't let me, don’t let me drown
[Verse 2]
So pull me up from down below
’Cause I'm underneath the undertow
Come dry me off and hold me close
I need you now, I need you most
[Chorus]God, keep my head above water
Don’t let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don’t let me, don't let me drown
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown (keep my head above water, above water)

And I can't see in the stormy weather
I can't seem to keep it all together
And I, I can't swim the ocean like this forever
And I can't breathe

God, keep my head above water
I lose my breath at the bottom
Come rescue me, I'll be waitingI'm too young to fall asleep

Can I make it any more obvious?He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say?He wanted her, she'd never tell
But secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes
[Chorus]He was a sk8er boi, she said ""see you later, boy""He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face, but her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth[Verse 2]Five years from now, she sits at home
Feeding the baby, she's all aloneShe turns on TV, guess who she sees
Sk8er boi rocking up MTVShe calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along, stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down
[Chorus 2]He was a sk8er boi, she said ""see you later, boy""
He wasn't good enough for herNow he's a superstar, slamming on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well, tough luck, that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story endsToo bad that you couldn't see
See the man that boy could be
There is more than meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside

He's just a boy and I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
We are in love, haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world?

I'll be backstage after the show
I'll be at a studio, singing the song we wrote

One of the best nights that I've had, no doubt
Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
A happy man, baby

This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brainIt was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down RosecransIt got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killedSeen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the ninePakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckersSuck a dick or die or sucker punchA wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, ""Aye, y'all—duck!""
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' that free lunchAw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approveBodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVsObviously the coroner between the sheets like the IsleysWhen you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correctMake sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collectThey say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threatYou movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guessM.A.A.d city[Chorus]

I'm hitting' easy street on mud tires

Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire, spread the wordLight the bonfire, then call the girlsThe king in the can and the Marlboro manJack 'n' Jim were a few good men
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue

And all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something ya'll don't know
Man that talk is getting old
Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talking, man, ya'll ain't listening
Them old dirt roads is what ya'll missing

The way we were raised, and our southern ways
And we like cornbread, and biscuits
And if it's broke round here we fix it
I can take ya'll where ya need to go
Down to my hood, back in them woods

We do it different 'round here, that's right
But we sure do it good, and we do it all night
See, if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in, and man, tell your friends
We'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends

Llama a su amiga, no le gusta salir sola
Y de la noche, dejarse llevar, oh...

Se pone caliente cuando escucha este perreo
Y yo también me pongo caliente si la veo

Que la cintura darle vela
Ma', pégate al frente y que suba esa tela
Que esto está afinca'o hasta que a ti te duela
Tú eres mi bebé, no te me salgas de al frente
Báilalo fuerte ¿qué importa la gente?
Algarete, no importa la gente
To' eso es pa' mí, bailando te di fuete

Y esto no para hasta que estés sin conciencia
Que quite la paciencia y te sueltes las piernas

Ahora imagínate en cupido (se puede morir)
No me vuelvo a enamorar
Yo de ti no me vuelvo a enamorar

Sigue tu camino que sin ti me va mejor
Ahora tengo a otra que me lo hace mejor
Si antes yo era un hijo e' puta ahora soy peor
Ahora soy peor, ahora soy peor por tiSigue tu camino que sin ti me va mejor
Ahora tengo a otras que me lo hacen mejor
Si antes yo era un hijo e' puta ahora soy peor
Ahora soy peor, ahora soy peor por ti
[Verso 1: Arcángel]
Dime como tú te sientes, sabiendo que no estoy yo, no
El tiempo ha pasado, tu nombre lo tengo borrado
Ahora soy el feo, el malo, ahora soy peor, eso lo sé yo
Pero me siento cabrón porque hay otro a tu lado y ese no soy yo
Venga, ahora voy a salir pa' la calle to' los días
Y voy a darme la vida que antes no tenía pero merecía
Tenga, puede ser que a veces por joder te de un pingazo
Luego de eso mas na', lo siento mamita no estoy en atraso

Antes corría por ti, ahora hago lo que quiero
Pa' decirte mentiras, yo te soy sincero
Si me va mejor, pero soy peor, tengo las mujeres que quiero
Vivo mi vida e' soltero, nadie me pone pero
Soy peor, pero estoy mucho mejor
Las maquinas son todas nuevas y a la baby le gusta el olor
Con esta le cambiamo' el taste, de la música somos la ley
Ando con el conejo en la race
Prendiendo una sour después que apagamos una haze
Soy peor, pero estoy mucho mejor
Las maquinas son todas nuevas y a la baby le gusta el olor
Con esta le cambiamo' el taste, de la música somos la ley
Ando con el conejo en la race
Prendiendo una sour después que apagamos una haze
[Verso 3: J Balvin]
Pa'l carajo el amor, que yo no nací pa' andar con dolor
Lo nuestro empezó muerto
Fue como esperar agua en el desierto
O algo de luz en la oscuridad
Cambiaste pasión por intensidad
Te mató tu inseguridad
No es secreto que a ti yo te odio
Como el Grinch odia la navidad
To' esto es tu culpa mami, ¿Por que tenías que ser así?
Ahora estoy viajando, me ves vacilando
Por lo tanto sufres baby
Ni creas que te extraño de noche en mi cama
Amanezco con dos por la mañana
Una de Brasil, otra Venezolana

Ahora tengo a otras que me lo hacen mejor
Si antes yo era un hijo e' puta ahora soy peor
Ahora soy peor, ahora soy peor por ti

Tú lo sabes ya, que yo no fumo regular
Traje una onza de kush y a tu amiga la puse a enrolar
Me dijo que tú le contaste y que quiere probar
Que te pasas hablando de mí y que no me puedes superar
No me dediques estados en Facebook porque no los leo
Ni me tires por Snapchat, lo tuyo yo nunca lo veo
Tú me hiciste peor, y del amor ateo

Do not trip on inhibitions

Like a pusher like a whore

Something that’s real before the end
Close the door
Turn the key

What you see?
Kill the lights

Set it off tonightBaby just like fire and gasoline

And sometimes I forget
These 10 digits ain't my lifeline any more
Every now and then, I dial 'em up
When life gets tough or when the Braves score
Sorry about the one ring hang-ups
Early morning and late night wake-ups
It was just me, in case you wondered
You've got dad's old number

So I apologize in advance
'Cause there's a damn good chance
When I meet that girl
Get that job
And I need to tell my best friend
You're probably gonna hear from me again

These 10 digits ain't my lifeline any more

Kid Rock,All Summer Long,https://genius.com/Kid-rock-all-summer-long-lyrics,"[Intro]It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and manShe was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ahh Ahh Ahh
Ahh Ahh Ahh
[Verse 1]
Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man, I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair
[Hook]
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
[Verse 2]
Catching wild life from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

While we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow

Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never endSometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man I'd love to see that girl again

We were smoking funny things

It goes (whistling), like dust in the wind

Call me hoss, I'm the boss with the sauce and the whores
No remorse for the sheriff, in his eye I ain't rightI'ma paint his town red then paint his wife white
Cause chaos rock like Amedeus
Find West Coast pussy for my Detroit playas
Mack like mayors ball like Lakers
They told us to leave but bet they can't make us
Why they wanna pick on me
Lock me up and snort away my key
I ain't no G, I'm just a regular failureI ain't straight outta Compton, I'm straight out the trailer

As bad as it looks

Your faith in all mankind would be the first thing you lose

But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?
[Verse 2]
Look, let me guess, you want to stay friends?
Tellin' people that's how we been?
Tellin' everybody, yeah, that we was barely speakin'
Ah, that's kinda funny, why'd you call me every day then?
It's immaturity, you goin' off the deep end
You just want somebody you can chill and get some drinks with, cool
Then don't hit me on the weekend, tellin' me you missed the way we talked and how I listen, yeah
Why you playin' with my mind, huh?
Why you playin' with my time, huh?
Told me, ""We should let it go and put it all behind us""
That's what I did, now you askin' me what I done, I was
Waitin' for this day, I saw it comin'
I think you just like attention, tryna tell me all your problems
I got issues of my own, I ain't got time for all this drama
You told me that you don't really wanna talk—then why you callin', huh?
[Chorus]
I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?

How you gonna lie, how you gonna lie like that?
Baby, how you gonna lie, how you gonna lie like that?
How you gonna lie, baby, how you gonna lie like that?
No, no, how you gonna lie like that?

NF,How Could You Leave Us,https://genius.com/Nf-how-could-you-leave-us-lyrics,"[Intro]How could you leave so unexpected?
We waited, we waited
For you, but you just left us
We needed you, I needed you
[Verse 1]Yo, I don't know what it's like to be addicted to pills
But I do know what it's like to be a witness, it kills
Mama told me she loved me, I'm thinkin' this isn't realI think of you when I get a whiff of that cigarette smell, yeah
Welcome to the bottom of hell
They say pain is a prison, let me out of my cell
You say you proud of me, but you don't know me that wellSit in my room, tears runnin' down my face and I yell
Into my pillowcases, say you comin' to get us
Then call a minute later just to tell us you not, I'm humiliatedI'm in a room with a parent that I don't barely know
Some lady in the corner watchin' us while she's takin' notesI don't get it, Mom, don't you want to watch your babies grow?
I guess pills are more important, all you have to say is ""no""
But you won't do it, will you? You gon' keep poppin', till them pills kill you
I know you're gone, but I can still feel you
[Chorus]
Why would you leave us? Why would you leave us?
How could you leave us here?
How could you leave us? Why would you leave us? Oh
Hey
[Verse 2]
I got this picture in my room and it kills me
But I don't need a picture of my mom, I need the real thing
Now a relationship is somethin' we won't ever have
But why do I feel like I lost somethin' that I never had?You shoulda been there when I graduated
Told me you loved me and congratulations
Instead you left us at the window waitin'
Where you at mom?
We're too young to understand, where you at, huh?
Yeah, I know them drugs have got you held captiveI can see it in your eyes, they got your mind captured
Some say it's fun to get the high, but I am not laughin'
And what you don't realize and what you're not graspin'
That I was nothin' but a kid who couldn't understand it
I ain't gon' say that I forgive you 'cause it hasn't happened
I thought that maybe I'd feel better as time passes
If you really cared for me, then where you at then?
[Chorus]
Why would you leave us? Why would you leave us?
How could you leave us here?
How could you leave us? Why would you leave us? Oh
Hey
[Verse 3]
Our last conversation, you and I sat in the livin' room
Talkin' 'bout my music and I brought you some to listen to
You started cryin', tellin' me this isn't youA couple weeks later, guess you were singin' a different tune
You took them pills for the last time, didn't you?
They took you from us once, I guess they came back to finish youCryin' my eyes out in the studio is difficult
Music is the only place that I can go to speak to youIt took everything inside of me, not to scream at your funeral
Sittin' in my chair, that person talkin' was pitiful
I wish you were here, mama, but every time I picture you
All I feel is pain, I hate the way I remember youThey found you on the floor, I could tell you felt hollow
Gave everything you had, plus your life to them pill bottles
You gave everything you had, plus your life to them pill bottles
Don't know if you hear me or not, but if you're still watchin', why?
[Chorus]
Why would you leave us? Why would you leave us?
How could you leave us here?
How could you leave us? Why would you leave us? Oh
Hey[Outro]
Sometimes I think about like...
Sometimes I think about things like, you know
When I'd have kids, I'm like...
You won't be there, you know?
You won't be there for any of that
And I'll never get to see you again
Sometimes I wish I would've just called you
I wish I would have just picked up the phone
Wish you were here
I mean you should've been there for us
You should have been here!
Them pills got you, right?
Them pills got you, right?

NF,Mansion,https://genius.com/Nf-mansion-lyrics,"[Chorus: Fleurie]Insidious is blind inception
What's reality with all these questions?Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
Slept inBroken legs, but I chase perfection
These walls are my blank expression
My mind is a home I'm trapped in
And it's lonely inside this mansion
[Verse 1: NF]Yo, my mind is a house with walls, covered in lyrics
They're all over the place, there's songs in the mirrors
Written all over the floors, all over the chairsAnd you get the uncut version of life when I go downstairsThat's where I write when I'm in a bad place and need to releaseAnd let out the version of NF you don't wanna see
I put holes in the walls with both of my fists till they bleed
You might get a glimpse of how I cope with all this anger in mePhysically abused, now that's the room that I don't wanna be in
That picture ain't blurry at all, I just don't wanna see itAnd these walls ain't blank, I just think I don't wanna see 'emBut why not? I'm in here, so I might as well read 'em
I gotta thank you for this anger that I carry aroundWish I could take a match and burn this whole room to the ground
Matter of fact, I think I'ma burn this room right now
Somehow, this memory, for some reason, just won't burn downYou used to put me in the corner, so you could see the fear in my eyes
Then took me downstairs and beat me till I screamed and I criedCongratulations, you'll always have a room in my mind
But I'ma keep the door shut and lock the lyrics inside
[Chorus: Fleurie]Insidious is blind inception
What's reality with all these questions?
Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
And slept inBroken legs, but I chase perfection
These walls are my blank expression
My mind is a home I'm trapped in
And it's lonely inside this mansion, inside this mansion
[Verse 2: NF]Yo, my mind is a house with walls, covered in painSee, my problem is, I don't fix things, I just try to repaint
Cover 'em up, like it never happened, say, ""I wish I could change""
Are you confused? Come upstairs and I'll show you what I mean
This room's full of regrets, it just keeps getting fuller, it seems
The moment I walk into it's the same moment that I wanna leave
I get sick to my stomach every time I look at these things
But it's hard to look past when this is the room where I sleepI look around, one of the worst things I wrote on these walls
Was the moment I realized that I was losing my mom
One of the first things I wrote was, ""I wish I woulda called""
But I should just stop now, we ain't got enough room in this songAnd I regret the fact that I struggled trying to find who I am
And I lie to myself and say I do the best that I can
Shrug it off like it ain't nothing, like it's out of my hands
Then get ticked off whenever I see it affecting my plans
And I regret watchin' these trust issues eat me alive
And at the rate I'm goin', they'll probably still be there when I die
Congratulations, you'll always have a room in my mindThe question is, will I ever clean the walls off in time?
[Chorus: Fleurie]Insidious is blind inception
What's reality with all these questions?
Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
And slept inBroken legs, but I chase perfection
These walls are my blank expression
My mind is a home I'm trapped in
And it's lonely inside this mansion, inside this mansion
[Verse 3: NF]
So this part of my house, no one's been in it for years
I built a safe room and I don't let no one in there'Cause if I do, there's a chance that they might disappear
And not come back, and I admit, I am emotionally scared
To let anyone inside, so I just leave my doors locked
You might get other doors to open up, but this door's not'Cause I don't want you to have the opportunity to hurt me
And I'll be the only person that I can blame when you desert meI'm barricaded inside, so stop watchin'
I'm not coming to the door, so stop knockin', stop knockin'
I'm trapped here, God keeps saying I'm not locked in
I chose this, I am lost in my own conscienceI know that shuttin' the world out ain't solvin' the problem
But I didn't build this house because I thought it would solve 'em
I built it because I thought that it was safer in thereBut it's not, I'm not the only thing that's livin' in hereFear came to my house years ago, I let him in
Maybe that's the problem, 'cause I've been dealing with this ever since
I thought that he would leave, but it's obvious, he never did
He must have picked a room and got comfortable and settled inNow I'm in a position, it's either sit here and let 'em win
Or put him back outside where he came from, but I never can
'Cause in order to do that, I'd have to open the doors
Is that me or the fear talking? I don't know anymore

NF,Remember This,https://genius.com/Nf-remember-this-lyrics,"[Chorus]
Yeah, they say when we grow up
You'll understand when you're older
Guess I'm still a kid, I don't know it
If I'll ever let go of this (yeah)
Say goodbye to the old me
We ain't friends anymore, you don't know me (real music)I know I could die any moment
If I do just remember this
[Verse 1]Yeah, handouts create lazy people I'm not impressed with
You want something in life, then why don't you go and get it?
Actions speak louder than words do, it's pretty quiet, isn't it?
Look at the world we live in, defined by comment sections
Surround yourself with people that challenge how you think
Not people that nod their head and act like they agree
Those people will cut you open just to watch you bleed
Always be yourself, not the person that you pretend to be, no!
These people gon' tell you that you will never make it
Then when you do, they gon' say they knew you were goin' places
That's just how it works, next thing you know you'll be overratedHearing people say they miss the ""old you,"" it's crazy, ain't it?
And perfect people don't exist, so don't pretend to be one
I don't need pats on the back from people for my achievements
When I die I wanna know that I lived for a reason
Anyone can take your life, but not what you believe in; no
[Chorus]
Yeah, they say when we grow up
You'll understand when you're older
Guess I'm still a kid, I don't know it
If I'll ever let go of this
Say goodbye to the old me
We ain't friends anymore, you don't know meI know I could die any moment
If I do just remember this
[Verse 2]Yeah, don't take opinions from people that won't listen to yoursIf money's where you find happiness, you'll always be poor
If you don't like the job you have, then what do you do it for?
The cure to pain isn't something you buy at liquor stores, nahThe real you is not defined by the size of your office
The real you is who you are when ain't nobody watchin'
You spend your whole life worried about what's in your wallet
For what? That money won't show up in your coffin, woo!Yeah, anger's a liar, he ain't got no respect
I fell in love with my pain and I slept with my regrets
Happiness saw it happen, maybe that's why she up and left
Joy called me a cheater, said she ain't coming backI've always had a problem with relationships
But that's what happens when you see the world through a broken lens
Mistakes can make you grow, that doesn't mean you're friends
Who you are is up to you, don't leave it up to them, no
[Chorus]
Yeah, they say when we grow up
You'll understand when you're older
Guess I'm still a kid, I don't know it
If I'll ever let go of this
Say goodbye to the old me
We ain't friends anymore, you don't know meI know I could die any moment
If I do just remember this
[Verse 3]
Yeah, they say you got into music, you signed up to be hated
That's kinda weird 'cause I don't remember signing my name upComing from people that give advice but never take none
I like my privacy, but, lately, I feel it's invaded
I heard that life's too short, don't let it pass you by
We waste a lot of time crying over wasted time
It's not about what people think, it's how you feel inside
My biggest failures in life are knowing I never tried, woo!
I look at the world from a different anglePeople change; even Satan used to be an angel
Think twice before you're bitin' on the hand that made you
Don't believe what you believe just 'cause that's how they raised you
Think your own thoughts, don't let them do it for youSay you want a drink, don't wait for people to pour it on you
Cut out the liars, stay close to the people you know are loyal
Grab your own glass and fill it, don't let your fear destroy you, woo!",Male

Yeah, yeah

We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (yeah)
Oh no, your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day she found a way out of the window to sneak out late
[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
She used to meet me on the EastsideIn the city where the sun don't set
And every day you know that we ride
Through the backstreets of a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah
[Chorus: Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your whole life then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life, together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
[Verse 2: Halsey]
Seventeen and we got a dream to have a family
A house and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly we turned twenty-three
Now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Have old friends and know our enemies
Now I-, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day you know where we ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me

We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your whole life then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life, together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

Well it was down some street we couldn't even pronounce
We were smoking a little from a half an ounce
The tequila was cheap but the flow we were feeling was real
Neither one of us looking for three little words
Unless those three words were 'do not disturb'
Checkout was s'posed to be noon but we slept in 'til three

She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key

Well I could still see her on the bed sitting Indian style
With my t-shirt on and a half drunk smile
She talked about Austin and how she'd get back there someday
We had the curtains wide open and a song on my phone
We danced by the TV we never turned on
And wondered would anyone miss us if we ran away
But this isn't one of those stories that ends up that way, no

For once in my lifeIt's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it rightAs I turned up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mindI see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat

Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me
Wondered was she photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely?

Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?

Es tan necesario
Es la boca suelta

Ser lo que se dice
Ser lo que se calla
Como ser la herida
Y ser la bala, bala, bala

Y este mundo el que yo mismo inventé
Ahora viene y me domina
Vuelve y me domina

Andando entre campos minados
Morir en estos dias extraños
No creo en el amor

El corazón al aire
Córtame las piernas
El disco que gira
La canción enterna

Y este mundo el que me obliga a perder
Es el mismo que me olvida
Cada vez que olvida

Someone like you is so hard to findYou can open up your eyes, or you can walk it blind
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you, don't you worryListen to me, I'ma set you free
He ain't gonna break your heart againGo through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When your imagination's on pretendI never thought that it would feel this way
You never taught me how to heal the painI wish you caught me on a different day
When it was easier to be happy

I don't expect you to be capableYou got the world right in your hands
And that responsibility is unescapableI promise that I'll be a different man
Please give me the chance to go and live againI'm having some trouble, can you give a hand?It seems perfection really is so unattainableDon't even say you 'bout to end it all
Your life precious, ain't no need to go and kill yourselfI'm not so sure that there's an end at all
I wish the truth would just reveal itselfWho do you call to make it to the top?
And who do you call to make the shooting stop?
And who do you call to give the coupe a wash?After everything I did, I think I'm still myself

And you may encounter dragons or ruffians and be called upon

In a battle for supremacy
And access to females glued to the TVAnd even if you are victorious
You may receive many cuts, bruises, and scrapes
And you will require band aids and antiseptic ointments
And tender loving kisses on your stab wounds
And when you come home
She will be there waiting for you with a fire in her eyes
And a big fat cannoli to shove in your mouth

Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?How am I going to be an optimist about this?

Y yo con ella en R.D. (haha-haha)
Que me enamoré el día que la probé
Yo ya no creo que vuelva y te dé
Mami, porque el servicio te lo cancelé
Si no respondo (¡já!) el problema va a tocar fondo
Mami, respira hondo mientra' te lo escondo (eso e' así)
Contigo obliga'o hoy yo me pongo el condón

De mi vida te boté y yo sé que no ere' cualquiera
Me pasaré la vida entera preguntando a dónde fue

Se tira una foto conmigo y me dice ""Pa' que tú la vea'""
Prendo pa' ver si me olvido

Miento si digo que no me hace falta cuando me rozaba tu piel

Miento si digo que no me hace falta que llames al amanecer

Pidiéndome que te agarre bien duro en la cama y te haga mi mujer

Calculan que relaciones que fracasan
Mayormente es por desengaño
Falsedad que contamina y hace daño
Tú fuiste perfecto clavel que con mis manos marchitéMi obra se llama ""Romeo sin Julieta otra vez""
Puedes pensar ""Soy el rey de las mentiras, volvería a fallar""

Adele,Hello,https://genius.com/Adele-hello-lyrics,"[Verse 1]Hello, it's meI was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everythingThey say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healingHello, can you hear me?I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and freeI've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
[Pre-Chorus 1]
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
[Chorus]Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be homeHello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
[Verse 2]Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

Are running out of time

I must've called a thousand times
To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done

That you found a girl and you're married now

Justin Timberlake,Where Is the Love?,https://genius.com/The-black-eyed-peas-where-is-the-love-lyrics,"[Verse 1: will.i.am]
What's wrong with the world, mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to the things that'll bring a trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryin' to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips, and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love, this'll set us straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear 'em cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
These people got me, got me questionin'
[Chorus: Justin Timberlake (and Fergie)]
Where is the love? (love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love, the love)
[Verse 2: Taboo]
It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases fillin' lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong?
With this world that we livin' in, people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividendsNot respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? (Come on, I don't know)
Where's the truth, y'all? (Come on, I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'Will you practice what you preach?And would you turn the other cheek?

Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love, the love)
[Verse 3: Apl.de.ap]
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm getting older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinemaWhatever happened to the values of humanity?
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality?
Instead of spreadin' love we spreadin' animosity
Lack of understandin' leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself…

'Til he burps and smoke purp?Does a word search get circles wrapped around it
Like you do when I come through?
I'd like you to remind yourself of what the fuck I can do
When I'm on the micOh, you're the kind of girl that I could take a likin' to
Psych! I'm spikin' you like a football
Been this way since I stood a foot tall
You're a good catch with a shitty spouse
Got a pretty mouth and a good jawGive me good brain, watch the wood-grain
Don't want no cum stain—bitch, you listenin'?Tryin' to turn me down, slut, I'm talkin' to you
Turn me back up! Are you insane?!Tryin' to talk over me in the car
Shut the fuck up while my shit's playin'!
I'm a shit stain on the underwear of lifeWhat's the saying? Where there's thunder, there is lightning
And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times
In three different locations on four separate occasions?
And you can bet your stankin' ass
That I've come to smash everything in my pathFork was in the road, took the psycho pathPoison Ivy wouldn't have me thinkin' rash
So hit the dance-floor, cutie, while I do my duty
On this microphone; shake your booty, shorty!I'm the shit—why you think Proof used to call me ""Doody""?

You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards

You're drunk, the carpet is burned
I hate to find you like this
I always find you like this
I come home and clean up your mess
What would you do without that?
Why do I always come back?
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you!

And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

[Verse 2: P!nk & Eminem]
Some nights I want to run for the hills
It's never easy with you
I cannot reason with you
But your smile is as rare as it comes
What would I do without that?
Maybe that's why I come back
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you!

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Startin' to think we were made for each other
But one of us in this relationship is raisin' the otherYou remind me of my mother
We drive one another crazy as each other
And we're both adults, so there's no excuse
For the games that we play with each otherWhere you at? At a friend's? No, you ain't, mothafucker!
But I give her the benefit of the doubt
Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver when I touch her
'Cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker
How her bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble
She's in hot water, think I caught her cheatin' again
Give her another chance? Another one after that?I'm swimmin' in that Egyptian river, 'cause I'm in denial
Say I don't eat shit, but I got a shit-eatin' grin when I smile
Makin' an excuse for us to act it out
She's just actin' out with her inner child
Then I set the truth on fire
'Cause I'd rather believe a lie
Then I breathe a sigh of relief, I don't believe in
Goin' to bed mad, I keep on tryin'
To make a bad girl good
But haven't I stood by you in good times?
And bad? I'm startin' to feel like your goddamn dad
'Cause I literally feel like you could die if ever should I
Leave you for good and never would I
It'd be all bad, never understood why they call it goodbye
But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy
And you're a good person too
I can save you, I can make you change
But I keep puttin' my fuckin' foot in my mouth
Every time I gotta come and bail you out
When you get in trouble that you get yourself in
And I'm in trouble, but I can't leave, I'll sell you out
I could never turn my fuckin' back on you—what is that?I'm co-dependent, I'm just now noticin' it
But somehow it's like every time I'm about to go to end itI ain't got the cojones to do it, nor the heart
Our apartment's tore apartYou're usin' my heart for a dartboardBut God must've aligned stars for us
'Cause somebody paired us up
And they say He ain't capable of makin' a mistake
But this one's perfect, 'cause I'm—

I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

Aretha Franklin,One Step Ahead,https://genius.com/Aretha-franklin-one-step-ahead-lyrics,"I'm only one step ahead of heartbreak
One step ahead of misery
One step is all I'd have to take backwards
To be the same old fool for you I used to be
I'm only one step ahead of your arms
One kiss away from your sweet lips
I know I can't afford to stop for one moment
Cause I'm just out of reach of your fingertips
Your warm breath on my shoulder
Keeps reminding me
That it's too soon to forget you
It's too late to be free, can't you see?
I'm only one step ahead of your love
I try and yet I can't take two
Seems like I'll have to take that one step backwards
Cause one step ahead is a step too far away from you
Cause one step ahead is a step too far away from you
Just one step ahead is a step too far away from you",Female

That you ever had
Kiss me once again

And no words could accurately paint this struggle
To heal these wounds they ain't made the ointment yet
It's tough to get by on that unemployment check
But Mom, I know you do it, I'm proud of you for that
I wish that I could prove whoever doubted you was whack
It's fact I always promised you that I'd never be far
But instead I'm going Hollywood trying to be a starBut see I've got dreams that I'm desperate to accomplish
But trying to find the time, 'bout to do it to be honest
I'm trying my way up to the top and that's my promise
I know that there's a deeper meaner here but that's beyond us

And every battle scar I have, if nothing else, it's proof
That I fucked up more times than I should've
More times than I would've liked

I'll make it if I try but I'm busying wasting time in the party scene

Trying to find a balance but my lifestyle is gnarlyAnd I'm continuously tardy to classes
Cause late is the fashion, it's a wonder how he passes
Still in school, trying to reach a buzzI rock shows and kick in front of more people than my teacher does
So tell me how I'm supposed to listen to a man on the stand who only makes 40 grand
Try to educate me, let these fucking college loans rape meI'd rather chase my dream without a clue where it'd take me
F following a system, I'm following my heart
I'd rather make music than to wallow in the dark

Oh well, guess beggars can't be chooseyWanted to receive attention for my musicWanted to be left alone in public, excuse meFor wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both waysFame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leafAbused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Ooh! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweetIt was like winnin' a used minkIronic ‘cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrinkI'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheepGoing coo-coo and kooky as Kool KeithBut I'm actually weirder than you think, ‘cause I'm—[Chorus: Rihanna and (Bebe Rexha)]I'm friends with the monster that's under my bedGet along with the voices inside of my headYou're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath

No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wandersYodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict‘Cause the very thing that I love's killing me
And I can't conquer it
My OCD is conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'

One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilianBut until then, drums get killed and
